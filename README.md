# TrueVoice — GenAI Legal & Support Companion (Hackathon Winner)

TrueVoice is a hackathon-winning, trauma-informed Generative AI (GenAI) companion designed to support survivors of sexual harassment/assault—initially focused on Irish higher education. It provides an anonymous first point of support: it listens without judgment, helps users regain calm, clarifies available options (legal, reporting, medical, counseling), and connects users to verified human services when needed.

## Why this project exists
Many survivors delay or avoid seeking help due to fear, shame, uncertainty about “what counts,” and confusion about where to go next. TrueVoice is built to reduce this first barrier by offering a private, 24/7, emotionally safe entry point that helps people move from silence to informed choice—at their own pace.

## What TrueVoice does
### 1) Trauma-informed emotional support
- Validates the user and avoids blame or judgment
- Uses short, calm, supportive responses (keeps the user in control)
- Supports emotional regulation with gentle grounding when distress is high

### 2) Practical guidance without pressure
- Explains options without assuming what the user wants (e.g., reporting is never pushed)
- Provides context-sensitive information: reporting pathways, medical care, counseling support, legal considerations, and self-care steps
- Uses locally relevant terminology and guidance (Ireland-focused)

### 3) Safety-first escalation and human handoff
- Detects crisis signals such as immediate danger or self-harm intent
- Switches into crisis support mode: calm urgency + clear next steps + emergency contact prompts
- Encourages real-world help (emergency services / Gardaí / crisis text line) and clearly communicates AI limits
- Supports “soft handoff” to human services when the user requests it or the situation exceeds the assistant’s scope

## Approach and methodology
TrueVoice was designed and refined through a structured, product-led GenAI workflow:

- **Problem mapping + BRD**: Defined user needs, institutional gaps, and trauma-aware principles.
- **Knowledge curation**: Gathered domain understanding of harassment/assault “grey areas,” support pathways, and local services.
- **Prompt-engineering (modular training)**:
  - Understanding survivor needs (emotions, trauma responses, barriers)
  - Safety and privacy logic (no personal data collection, crisis triggers)
  - Conversational flow and tone (gentle openings/closings, pacing)
  - Ethical boundaries (user-led conversation, non-directive guidance)
- **Few-shot dialogue sampling**: Created safe example conversations and response templates for common scenarios.
- **Localisation**: Tuned responses to Ireland-specific pathways and language (university reporting portals, Garda protocols, SATU pathways, NGOs/helplines).
- **Testing and iteration**: Piloted conversations with user feedback, then refined tone, pacing, and “don’t overwhelm” constraints (e.g., shorter responses, content filters).

## Key principles (built-in safety & ethics)
- User agency first: the survivor leads; the assistant follows.
- Privacy by design: avoid collecting identifying information.
- Non-directive guidance: offer options, never pressure.
- Inclusive and respectful language: no assumptions about gender, perpetrator, or outcome.
- Crisis-aware behavior: prioritize safety and human help in high-risk situations.

## Deliverables included in this project
- Product requirements and interaction protocols (BRD)
- Trauma-informed training prompt and behavior rules for the assistant
- Final report describing the solution, safety model, and pilot learnings
- Pitch/prototype materials created for hackathon delivery

## Future direction (optional)
- Deeper integration with campus reporting systems and counseling pathways
- Broader expansion beyond universities (workplaces and public institutions)
- Stronger evaluation framework: usability, trust, and safety testing at scale
- More robust governance: audit logs (non-identifying), bias review, and model risk controls
